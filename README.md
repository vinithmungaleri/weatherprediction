# weatherprediction

1. Performed Exploratoty Data Analysis on Weather data set using Pandas, Numpy and visualized the data using Matplotlib, Searborn.

2. As an Experiment, Performed Decision Tree Regressor, K-Means and LSTM Algorithms on the transformed data set to compare the best algorithm for weather prediction.

3. LSTM outperformed other algorithms with 99% accuracy.

# How to use the code

1. Downlaod the code from github as zip file.
2. Run the Weather_prediction.ipynb file on your Jupyter Notebook.
